"""Mock provider — the offline fallback so Triage runs with zero API keys.

It returns deterministic answers from a tiny built-in knowledge base, plus
*synthetic* per-token logprobs, and it deliberately injects variability at
higher temperature for questions it is unsure about. That makes every proxy
signal (uncertainty, instability, contradiction, retrieval-disagreement,
evidence) exercise real code paths without any network call.
