"""Calibrate verify.overhead_tokens from real telemetry — so the verify cost
guard uses a MEASURED overhead instead of a magic constant.

The verify pass adds a second LLM call. Its overhead is estimated as the
difference in median total tokens (in+out) between requests that ran a verify
pass and those that did not. This is a telemetry estimate (verified requests are
the harder ones, so treat it as an upper-ish bound), printed as a recommended
value for `verify.overhead_tokens` in config/router.yaml.
