"""Online Learning Router.

RouteLLM calibrates a single routing threshold OFFLINE against a fixed preference
dataset; if production traffic drifts from that dataset the calibration rots. This
module tunes Triage's escalation threshold (`risk_high`) ONLINE from live outcomes,
per small-model, with no labels required.

Self-supervised feedback signal (no ground truth needed):
  * an escalation was USEFUL if the big model's abstain-risk came out materially
    below the small model's risk (escalating actually reduced unreliability);
  * it was WASTED if the big risk was ~the same (the small model was already fine,
    or the big model didn't help).

Controller: nudge `risk_high` toward a target escalation rate, but let usefulness
override — escalate more when it keeps paying off, less when it's mostly wasted.
State persists to data/online_state.json so learning survives restarts.
