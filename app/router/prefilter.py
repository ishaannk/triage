"""Tier -1: the hybrid predict-then-route pre-filter.

RouteLLM routes on the prompt alone (predict-then-route). Triage's core is
observe-then-allocate (run the cheap model, read its signals). This module is the
HYBRID front-end that gets the best of both: a cheap, training-free difficulty
estimate from prompt lexical features + Semantic Routing Memory that decides, BEFORE
any generation:

  * easy_direct : obviously-easy AND memory says similar prompts were safe ->
                  run the small model on a fast path (suppress the deep signal probes).
  * hard_direct : obviously-hard (math/multi-step/known-to-escalate) -> SKIP the small
                  pass entirely and go straight to the big model (no wasted small spend).
  * normal      : ambiguous -> fall through to the full observe-then-allocate loop,
                  where the small model's OWN output signals make the call.

The output-signal escalator is always the safety net behind this predictor, so a
wrong "easy" guess is still caught by the live signals. Fully explainable: every
decision returns the features that fired.
