"""Tier-L long-context route — a FLAG, orthogonal to the 0..3 reliability tiers.

HONEST NAMING (remediation C-8): this is NOT the inherited "CRPA" attention
primitive (chunked partitions, relay tokens, causal filtering for 64k contexts).
That module is **not built** in Triage — see CHARTER.md (out of scope for the
API-only pivot). This file only *detects* long-context requests so telemetry/UI
can show the route was taken and a real primitive could later slot in behind the
same interface. It counts retrieved evidence toward the context length so a long
prompt built from many retrieved documents is flagged correctly.
