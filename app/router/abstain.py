"""Abstain policy — a PURE multi-signal function.

Hard requirement: no single signal can force an abstain. We build a weighted
risk score from ALL signals and only abstain when (a) the combined risk crosses
`abstain_threshold` AND (b) at least `min_elevated_signals` distinct signals are
individually elevated. Both guards make the decision genuinely multi-signal.
